#if dubplicated ABs should be used -> increases total number of ABs

#we disturb the duplicate AB counts in the following way
#1.) multiply with a random value between abDuplicateRange 2.) put gaussian noise around this value, 
#sigma of this gaussDist is the abDuplicateDisturbance * <above calculated new ABcount>abDuplicateDisturbance=0.1
